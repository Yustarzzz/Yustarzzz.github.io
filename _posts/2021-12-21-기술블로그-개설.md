I opened my new research note(which is also used as my technical blog)! This is for more efficient research and study.  
So, today I will post How I start my github blog. I wish it will helpful to people who are struggling with starting their first github blog.  



## 1. Make initial github blog

Firstly,I made a new repository that'll be used as my blog.  
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63712119/146897931-da2b2b0a-90dc-41df-8327-17e44a9bc018.png">
> note! You have to set the repository name as "your username of github.github.io".

  
Then clone this repository to my local computer by under command line.  

```cpp
$ git clone 'your repository path'
```

Then, move to cloned folder.    
```cpp
$ cd 'your repository path'
```
To test whether your blog works well, make index.html like below.
```cpp
$ echo "Hello World" > index.html
```
Now, You will have "index.html" in your folder.  
  
And then, add modified or new files to github index (which is a structure of github system) by below command line.
```cpp
$ git add --all
```
Now, you are ready to commit and push it to your remote repository.  
Let's commit and push!  
```cpp
$ git commit -m "Your customized commit name"
$ git push -u origin main
```
Now, you can see your repository is updated.

Congratulations! Now, you can see your own blog on web.

## 2. Design your github blog with Jekyll
You can find some wonderful Jekyll templates at [Jamstackthemes].

[Jamstackthemes]: https://jamstackthemes.dev/ssg/jekyll/page/2/ 
In here, select a template which you like.  
  
After you selected a template, download ZIP file at github of the template.  
  
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63712119/146902913-66e6a234-475b-4ebc-846a-4c596bb7304a.png">
  
And then, copy all files in your local repository folder. (You need to rewrite some files of your original one if there are also files which have same name.)  
    
<img src = "https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63712119/146903212-7a71d5af-6339-42d7-965e-3db08c86e244.png">
  
Next step is installing all packages written in Gemfile. Before we doing this, we have to install Ruby.  
You can download it at [Ruby website].

[Ruby website]: https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/

After doing this, let's install packages written in Gemfile.
```cpp
$ bundle install
```

Now, you are ready to run local server to check your blog before push it.  
```cpp
$ bundle exec jekyll serve --trace
```

Congratulations! It's done!  
Now you can set your blog in your local computer and check it on local server before push it.  
  
Finally, push your blog on your remote repository.  
```cpp
$ git add --all
$ git commit -m "commit message"
$ git push
```
Then, you can check your blog on web.
